This simple password generator allows users to generate random passwords of a specified length. This project was developed as part of the Scrimba curriculum.

## Key Learnings

- **Math.random() Function:** Utilized `Math.random()` to generate random characters for the password.
- **let and const Variables:** Practiced using `let` and `const` to declare variables within the JavaScript code.
- **for Loop:** Employed a `for` loop to iterate through the characters array and generate random passwords.
- **Figma Design Tool:** Utilized Figma for designing and prototyping the user interface of the password generator.
